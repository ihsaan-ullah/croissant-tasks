    "description": "This Insect Classification task uses the micro version of Meta-Album INS dataset. The goal is to classify insects into different classes/categories. Submitted models are supplied a train set for training and a test set for predictions. The predictions are saved along with the test ground truth. During evaluation Balanced accuracy and F1 scores are computed.",

      "description": "The original Insects dataset is created by the National Museum of Natural History, Paris (https://www.mnhn.fr/fr). It has more than 290 000 images in different sizes and orientations. The dataset has hierarchical classes which are listed from top to bottom as Order, Super-Family, Family, and Texa. Each image contains an insect in its natural environment or habitat, i.e, either on a flower or near to vegetation. The images are collected by the researchers and hundreds of volunteers from SPIPOLL Science project(https://www.spipoll.org/). The images are uploaded to a centralized server either by using the SPIPOLL website, Android application or IOS application. The preprocessed insect dataset is prepared from the original Insects dataset by carefully preprocessing the images, i.e., cropping the images from either side to make squared images. These cropped images are then resized into 128x128 using Open-CV with an anti-aliasing filter.",
